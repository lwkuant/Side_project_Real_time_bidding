# Side_project_Real_time_bidding

## Overview
The goal of this work is to conduct classification problem using machine learning techniques. What makes this work special is that the dataset is very unbalanced, which makes it relatively hard to tackle, for example, we cannot use accuracy as a metric and it is very likely not to spot the class we are interested in. Therefore, I will implement methods such as undersampling to handle this problem. 

I think this dataset serves as a great opportunity to simulate working with real world data, which is never as simple as the examples we see in the textbooks.

The related information regarding this dataset can be accessed below:
